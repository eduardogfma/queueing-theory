    "## Theoretical Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system comprised of $s$ servers. Customers compete with each other over a limited number of servers in the following way: when approaching the system, if there is an available server, customer $j$ enters the system and consumes/occupies it, otherwise goes away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is said to be in state $E_{j}~(j=0,1,...,s)$ when the number of customers in the system is $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_{j}$ be the proportion of time that the system spends in state $E_{j}$ (i.e. the proportion of time that $j \\leq s$ servers are busy serving $j$ customers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoting the _customer arrival rate_ (i.e. the average number of arrivals per unit time) by $\\lambda$ yields, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda P_{j} = E_{j} \\rightarrow E_{j+1}, \\quad j=0,1,...,s-1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{j} \\rightarrow E_{j+1}$ is the rate at which the transition from state $E_{j}$ to state $E_{j+1}$ occurs. Note that letting $j=s$ would imply a transition to the impossible state $E_{s+1}$ (i.e. $E_{j} \\rightarrow E_{j+1} = E_{s} \\rightarrow E_{s+1}, \\quad j=s$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\tau$ be the _mean holding time_ of a server by customer (i.e. average length of time a customer holds a server). Conversely, if $\\tau$ expresses 'unit time/customer', the termination rate for a single customer is given by $1/\\tau$ ([customer/unit time]). Similarly, the termination rate for two simultaneous customers is given by $2 \\times \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{2}{\\tau}$. Then, by this reasoning, the termination rate for $j+1$ simulataneous customers is therefore $\\frac{(j+1)}{\\tau}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the system is in state $E_{j+1}$ for a proportion of time $P_{j+1}$, on can right the following\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{j+1} \\rightarrow E_{j} = \\frac{j+1}{\\tau}P_{j+1}, \\quad j=0,1,...,s-1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be read as \"the downward transition $E_{j+1} \\rightarrow E_{j}$ occurs at rate $\\frac{j+1}{\\tau}P_{j+1}$ transitions per unit time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the system working in steady state corresponds to the situation where the number of incomming customers equals the outgoing ones, one can write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{j} \\rightarrow E_{j+1} = E_{j+1} \\rightarrow E_{j}, \\quad j=0,1,...,s-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda P_{j} = \\frac{j+1}{\\tau}P_{j+1}, \\quad j=0,1,...,s-1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the previous equations recurrently yields,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{j} = \\frac{(\\lambda\\tau)^j}{j!}P_{j+1}, \\quad j=1,2,...,s.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, since the numbers $\\{P_{j}\\}$ are proportions, they must sum to unity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{0}+P_{1}+...+P_{s} = 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the last two equations, one can determine $P_{0}:$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{0} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{s}\\frac{(\\lambda\\tau)^k}{k!} \\right)^{-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the proportion $P_{j}$ of time that $j$ servers are busy is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{j} = \\frac{(\\lambda\\tau)^{j}/j!}{\\sum_{k=0}^{s}(\\lambda\\tau)^{k}/k!}, \\quad j=0,1,...,s.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An important observation to be made from the last formula is that the proportions $P_{j}$ depende on the arrival rate $\\lambda$ and mean holding time $\\tau$ only through the product $\\lambda\\tau$. This product is a measure of the demand made on the system; it is often called the _offered load_ and given the symbol $a$, i.e. $a=\\lambda/\\tau$. The numerical values are expressed in units called _erlangs_ (erl), after Danish mathematician and teletraffic theorist A. K. Erlang who first published the previous formula in 1917.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $j=s$, the right-hand side becomes the well-known _Erlang loss formula_, denoted in the USA by $B(s,a)$ and Europe be $E_{1,s}(a)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B(s,a)=\\frac{a^{s}/s!}{\\sum_{k=0}^{s}a^{k}/k!}.$$"
